Software that emulates Intelecon EDDS controller

GatewayApp is console dotnetcore v2.1 app that can send data to Intelecon PollService app via Intelecon UDP v2 protocol. It can be configured for futher communication with IoT controllers (like LoraWAN (Mousqito MQTT, broocar's app server), ZigBee, etc). So GatewayApp is data adapter for Intelecon PollService :)
